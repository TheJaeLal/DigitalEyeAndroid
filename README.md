Digital Eye Android Implementation

This repository contains source code for 2 apps Digital Eye (Main App) and face-rec-engine (supplementary App)

The 2nd app is required if you want to access 'Identify Person' (face recognition) functionality

So it is reccomended to build and install both applications
